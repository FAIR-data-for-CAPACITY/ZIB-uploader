    "# Converting ZIB to RDF\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Convert FHIR/XML or FHIR/JSON data to/from FHIR/RDF. Open source implementations that can perform this conversion include:\n",
    "    - HAPI java Reference library (Same code as used in the build)\n",
    "    - Reference Server (based on Delphi reference implementation )\n",
    "    - fhir-net-api , a .NET implementation. (should work on Mono )\n",
    "    - Check the HL7 Open Source FHIR Implementations page, in case new implementations have become available\n",
    "1. Download the FHIR ontology.\n",
    "1. Download other ontologies that you wish to use with your application, such as the SNOMED-CT ontology. (Because of license restrictions, the process of obtaining the SNOMED-CT ontology is more complex than a simple download. Some guidance is provided here .)\n",
    "1. Create or obtain a bridge ontology that relates terms in the FHIR ontology to terms in your other ontologies.\n",
    "1. Load your FHIR/RDF instance data and your ontologies into a reasoner and/or a triplestore, and perform SPARQL queries and/or reasoning.\n",
    "1. If you are creating FHIR/RDF then you might also wish to validate it, using ShEx . If so, you can download the ShEx schema for FHIR/RDF"
